[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kiler129/CherryHttp.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kiler129/CherryHttp) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/kiler129/CherryHttp/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/kiler129/CherryHttp/coverage)  [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/kiler129/CherryHttp/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/kiler129/CherryHttp)   
Fast, secure, customizable and easy to use HTTP/1.1 server implementation. It's also licensed under MIT, so feel free to use it in your commercial project ;)  
Originally it was part of [TinyWs](https://github.com/kiler129/TinyWs), but it evolved into standalone project to provide modular architecture.

## You're looking at shiny-new CherryHttp v2
Since original CherryHttp proven there's a place for HTTP server written in PHP life & project moves on.  
First version had some architecture quirks and performance bottlenecks which CherryHttp v2 attempts to resolve.  

Please keep in mind master tree (where v2 development is made) is NOT intended to general usage just yet. If you're looking for stable release switch to [v1](https://github.com/kiler129/CherryHttp/tree/1.0) tree, which is not obsoleted in any way.
